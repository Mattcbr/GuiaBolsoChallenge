## App Description

This app was developed as part of the [GuiaBolso's](https://www.guiabolso.com.br/) selection process. It consists of a two-screen app where the first one will give you a list of Categories to choose from, and a "hit me" button where it will select a random category. The second screen will give you you a Joke of the selected category, its description and a button to see the Joke's webpage. All the Jokes and Categories are retrieved from the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/).
